# Shahaf

## Workflow
- Works with ~10 clones on local machine
- Each feature: pulls main, creates new branch, works with agent, opens PR
- Separate checkout per feature

## Questions Asked
- About worktrees vs checkouts workflow (sparked by Twitter thread)
- How to work on multiple features in parallel with trunk-based development
- Challenged feature flags approach: "זה עדיין לא אומר שאתה יכול לכתוב כמה במקביל"

## Positions
- Skeptical about running multiple agents on same codebase: "בלתי אפשרי הם מתנגדים"
- Eventually agreed worktrees vs checkouts is "tabs vs spaces" debate
