## Git Workflows Discussion (06:08-06:36)

[[shahaf]] shared Twitter thread (dpetrou) about git workflows - author doesn't use worktrees, uses multiple clones instead. Sparked discussion on [[worktrees-vs-checkouts]].

**[[shahaf]]'s workflow:** ~10 clones on machine, pull main → branch → work with agent → PR for each feature.

**[[michael]]'s take:** Multiple checkouts cleaner than worktrees because no manual cleanup needed when done. "בcheckout נפרד אתה פשוט ממשיך עם החיים שלך, בworktree אתה צריך למחוק אותו דרך git cli"

**Conclusion:** "לא אין המון הבדל, זה דיון של tabs vs spaces" - both valid approaches.

### Trunk-Based Development Tangent

[[michael]] expressed preference for working on main with feature flags. Led to discussion of [[trunk-based-with-feature-flags]].

**[[shahaf]]'s challenge:** How to work on multiple features in parallel? Claims multiple agents on same codebase is impossible ("בלתי אפשרי הם מתנגדים").

**[[michael]]'s response:** 
- Feature flags enable incomplete features on main (disabled)
- Branching allowed but short-lived (half day to one day)
- For multi-agent: need lock files, see [[agent-teams-blog-post]]
- Acknowledges not fully solved problem

## Resources Shared

- [[agent-teams-blog-post]] by [[michael]] (06:34) - multi-agent coordination building C compiler

## Model Chat (06:36-06:38)

[[ori-levi]] asked about Sonnet 4.6 experience. [[michael]] responded: better than 4.5, not Opus level. "כן, אופוס זה אופוס."

[[ori-levi]] mentioned Twitter hype, [[michael]] noted price difference significant for products, less so for development.

Brief exchange about distillation - [[michael]] believes 4.5 was distillation of previous Opus.
